# Hand Pose Estimation And Classification

This project is an extention of TRT Pose for Hand Pose Detection. The project includes 

- Pretrained models for hand pose estimation capable of running in real time on Jetson Xavier NX.

- Scripts for applications of Hand Pose Estimation

  -  Hand gesture recoginition (hand pose classification) 
  
  -  Cursor control 
  
  -  Mini-Paint type of application 
  
- Pretrained model for gesture recoginition 

## Getting Started 

### Step 1 - Install trt_pose and it's dependencies 

Make sure to follow all the instructions from trt_pose and install all it's depenedencies. 
Follow the following instruction from https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose. 

### Step 2 - Install dependecies for hand pose 

### Step 3 - Run hand pose and it's applications 

    A) Hand Pose demo 

    B) Hand gesture recoginition (hand pose classification) 

    C) Cursor control application

    D) Mini-Paint

The model was trained using the training script in trt_pose and the hand pose data collected in Nvidia.
